This is a repository to test all things that i have been learning about Git and GitHub in Platzi.

- Make a repository in my computer with Git and upload it to Git Hub .
- Make commits to save and keep all my changes in my projects.
- Work with different branches and merge them .
- Create SSH keys and use them to conect my git repository with GitHub. 🔐
- Understand the workflow.
- Make a fork and a pull request.
- Create a .gitignore file to avoid push binary large objects (BLOB) and other private files.

## Content
1. A .txt file that contains a few text lines about me, where could I understand how Git control the versions, how to stage files and how to make a commit. Also I understood the meaning of the difference of bytes among each change and version of the project.

3. Blogpost.html, in this file mainly I understood how to use branches like a branch header and a branch footer, then merge them into a branch main or master. On the other Hand I learned about workflows and I used some HTML and CSS to shape the blog.
